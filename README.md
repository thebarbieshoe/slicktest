# Project: Digital Monitor Version Slick

I've decided to work on my digital slides and convert to a Slick Slider. I think it'll be easier to format and use in the future

## Inspiration

I wanted to try the slick slider after really enjoying the style of a codepen by Jake Speer. I forked it and tried to use it on my own and really liked the effect.

### First Challenge

After forking and modifying the codepen concept for my purposes, I had one glaring issue. The first slide, perfect. The second slide would still show about 4 pixels of the last slide. Then the next, 8 pixels, The next, 12 pixels.
...
Because of this issue I wanted to start completely from scratch!

#### First Commit
This version is a very simple slick slider that works without that lag issue. I wanted to make sure I saved this version because it'll be an excellent jumping off point for other projects.
